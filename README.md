# MANUFACTURING-VALUE-PER-COUNTRY

This project analyzes the manufacturing value added by various countries over time, with a focus on recent data from 2023 and historical trends. The analysis highlights the top contributors to global manufacturing, allowing for an in-depth look into each country’s manufacturing sector and its contribution to the global economy.


Here's a "README" template based on your project focused on manufacturing added value by country, which seems to be visualized using Tableau. You can modify and adapt it as needed.

README: Manufacturing Added Value by Country
Project Overview
This project analyzes the manufacturing value added by various countries over time, with a focus on recent data from 2023 and historical trends. The analysis highlights the top contributors to global manufacturing, allowing for an in-depth look into each country’s manufacturing sector and its contribution to the global economy.
